```lrc
[00:00.11] I've heard the call
[00:03.72] I've made my choice
[00:06.10] To trade my life for eternal colours among the stars
[00:13.13] This machine will be the death of me
[00:15.85] But it'll show me who I'm meant to be
[00:19.80] A world of my own mind's creation stands ahead
[00:42.80] 
[00:35.82] Already I start to feel my body fade away
[00:41.02] As my life and mind are transformed
[00:44.25] From atoms to pixels
[00:48.42] My polygonal form takes shape
[00:51.66] There's not much longer to wait now
[00:55.40] Our journey is about to begin
[01:09.90] 
[01:26.89] There's no return, there's no return
[01:32.35] I'm leaving everything, I'm leaving everything behind
[01:39.58] This machine will be the death of me
[01:42.69] But it'll show me who I'm meant to be
[01:46.35] A world of my own mind's creation stands ahead
[02:09.35] 
[02:30.84] My polygonal form takes shape
[02:34.04] There's not much longer to wait now
[02:37.65] Our journey is about to begin
[02:52.15] 
[03:08.94] There's no return, there's no return
[03:14.58] I'm leaving everything, I'm leaving everything behind
[03:22.04] Is this what I wanna do?
[03:25.41] Is this what it's coming to?
[03:28.47] Ah well, a virtual home like I'd always dreamed
[03:51.97] 
[03:42.82] A virtual home like I'd always dreamed
